hi welcome back to PC Builder I'm Jason now whether you are new or returning PC Builder 2023 is a great time to build a PC this PC parts explain 2023 video will show you what PC parts you need for the best PC build including the best gaming PC build we'll cover each part what you need to know when buying them and how they all connect together to build a PC will also go through the best CPU and GPU combo for every budget especially for a gaming PC build remember if you get value out of the video please give a like because it really helps out the channel and of course subscribe click that Bell icon that way you get notified when we release cool content with that let's jump into it now for the best gaming PC build 2023 your number one focus is your GPU Choice GPU stands for graphics Processing Unit but they're also sometimes called the graphics card or video card now currently we're in the middle of a new generation of gpus being launched and there are good value previous generation gpus available as well the GPU plugs into the motherboard and use the outputs on the back of the card rather than on the back of the motherboard to get the video signal now graphics cards they're primarily made by AMD and Nvidia however Intel launched its own GPU lineup in 2022. I'm happy to say that right now mainstream gpus from any of these companies are excellent for gaming or streaming gameplay to a service like twitch or YouTube for specific GPU recommendations for you see our monthly GPU market update video series where we review the best GPU to buy right now at every budget level and I'll leave a link to that video in the description your GPU choice and the types of games that you play are going to determine what monitor resolution that you can use and how many frames per second called FPS that you can get now there's more on that in our bets gaming monitor 2023 guide so I'll leave a link to that one down in the description as well the currently relevant gpus which can be purchased brand new include nvidia's newest gpus in their RTX 4000 series lineup some previous generation in Nvidia RTX 3000 Series gpus that are still available as well as some older gpus like the RTX 2060 on the AMD side their newest GPU lineup is their radon rx7000 series gpus as well as their very good last generation radon RX 6000 series gpus from the 6950 XT down to the rx6600 do not buy the 6500 XT or lower for Intel they currently have two models The Arc a770 and the much cheaper and almost as fast Arc a 750. let's also talk about vram that is the video Ram or memory that is directly soldered onto the GPU itself which cannot be altered by a PC Builder so for instance the RX 7900 XT comes with 20 Gigabytes of vram well a similarly priced RTX 4070 TI it only comes with 12 gigabytes in 2023 we're finding that at least for some of the latest AAA games being launched if you want to play it Ultra or high settings at 1440p 4K and sometimes even 1080p that you need more vram than in the past and turning on features like Ray tracing it increases the amount of vram that you need my general recommendation right now is that if you're buying a GPU for more than 300 you want to get at least 12 gigabytes of vram and 16 gigabytes seems to be the safe spot for future proofing against all future releases right now if two gpus cost about the same and deliver the same frames per second I would probably buy the one that offers more vram for professional level production users who do video editing blender animation CAD or similar types of work then generally Nvidia gpus are better supported in some of these professional Suites like Adobe though AMD is catching up as is Intel now let's jump into the central processing unit or CPU now there's two major CPU makers AMD and Intel they make a variety of CPUs but today we're just focusing on consumer desktop CPUs the CPU connects into the motherboard and is the brain of the computer but the CPU itself has more more than one brain it can use at a time called a core now most modern processors they're at least four cores and currently come in 6 8 10 12 and 16 core versions the more cores the more the CPU can do it once though some tasks like gaming only need between four and eight cores depending on the game and how powerful the CPU is now most AMD and Intel CPUs have cores that can do up to two tasks at the same time something we call multi-threading so when I say that the AMD ryzen 5 7 600 has six cores and 12 threads that means it has six cores that can roughly do two things at the same time note that with Intel's 12th and 13th generation CPUs they've introduced a big little design with big cores that they call Performance cores which can multi-thread and smaller cores which they call efficiency cores that are single threaded so the Intel i5 13600k has six performance cores that can each multi-thread and eight efficiency cores that are single threaded for a total of 14 cores and 20 threads the most currently relevant AMD CPUs are the ryzen 7000 CPUs and the ryzen 5000 CPUs for Intel their most recent CPUs include Intel 13 generation CPUs and the 12th generation CPUs currently the fastest gaming CPU is the ryzen 7800 X 3D which contains extra onboard memory called Cash stacked vertically on the CPU hence the 3D in its name AMD ryzen CPUs are unlocked meaning you can overclock them if you choose to and you can also overclock the memory with them Intel CPUs labeled with a K in the name can also be overclocked like the I5 13600k but only on compatible z-series motherboards more on that later but none of the other Intel CPUs can be overclocked however the memory can be overclocked on a compatible z-series motherboard for any of the Intel CPU generations and 12th and 13th gen CPUs can support higher speed memory on compatible b660 and b760 motherboards some CPUs come with integrated Graphics like all of the Intel CPUs that do not have an F in the name and the AMD CPUs that do have a g in their name like the ryzen 5600g integrated Graphics means you can get a video signal without a dedicated graphics card now while there's some talk about more powerful integrated Graphics CPUs coming in the future which may replace budget gpus at least right now I would only recommend integrated Graphics builds for web browsing or light office work like word processing so what's the right CPU and GPU combo for you well it depends on what you're doing for gaming you want the best GPU that you can buy and a CPU that simply will not bottleneck the GPU or the game if you're doing more multi-core heavy work like video editing engineering or animation you're going to want a reasonably fast CPU with more cores and at least something like an Nvidia RTX 2060 or better the best thing to do is to make a list of the programs that you use and see what the recommended specs are for those programs later in the video we'll go through the best CPU and GPU combo for gaming at 1080P 1440p and 4K gaming PC builds let's talk about motherboards we've done a number of best motherboard videos for AMD ryzen CPUs as well as Intel CPUs and those videos are part of the how to build a PC playlist down in the video description the motherboard is the thing that all the components plug into and allows them to work together now while motherboards are made by manufacturers like Asus ASRock gigabyte and MSI they are made using what's called a chipset that is specific to AMD or to Intel so you can't use an AMD CPU with an Intel chipset motherboard and vice versa and each CPU will only work with a specific chipset Verizon 7000 CPUs you want an AMD 600 series motherboard in the x670 b650 OR a620 series for ryzen 5000 CPUs you generally want an AMD 500 series motherboard like a b550 x570 or a 520 chipset motherboard for Intel 12th and 13th generation CPUs with a K in their name which again means they're overclockable you'll likely want a z690 or z790 motherboard for a locked 12th and 13th generation Intel CPUs again the ones without the can the name you generally want to use a cheaper b660 or b670 motherboard though you can use z690 or z790 motherboards as well it is confusing because both AMD and Intel use very similar naming schemes for their motherboard chipsets so just make sure to check compatibility before you buy your motherboard now motherboards come in different sizes with the most common sizes being full size or ATX size motherboards half size versions called Micro ATX motherboards or matx and even smaller versions with single pcie slots called ITX motherboards on the back of the motherboard there will be USB ports of varying speeds audio outputs for onboard sound wired and wireless networking and display outputs if you're not using a dedicated GPU other boards also have two to four slots for Ram SATA connections for SATA storage drives at least one slot for m.2 storage drives and connections for the system fans RGB and front PC case USB and audio ports the motherboard has an onboard operating system called bios which allows you to change the way the motherboard the Ram or other components run one of the important motherboard features is the power delivery on the motherboard called the vrms a little half square around the CPU which will often have a heatsink to avoid overheating under heavy use now you need to pay close attention to these if you're using an 8 or greater core CPU there are also the PCI Express slots also called PCI slots now this top one is for graphics cards and is a buy 16 slot that refers to the number of PCI lanes and also the length of the connection and they vary in size depending on how much bandwidth they have including by eight by four and by one slots note that the smaller add-in cards can be used in the larger what PCI Lanes can go with different speeds and the current fastest ones are pcie Gen 4 and pcie gen 5. now while having internal pcie Gen 5 Lanes is great because it means you can connect more total devices you do not need a motherboard capable of using pcie Gen 5 gpus which don't even exist yet or pcie Gen 5 storage devices let's talk about the onboard audio now all modern motherboards come with it but you aren't always using it if you plug in an analog audio device with a connector into the motherboard or the front panel of the PC case you're using the onboard motherboard audio section processing if you use a connection like HDMI or USB then you're using a digital signal to transfer the audio processing to a secondary device like a stereo receiver now the quality of the onboard audio can usually be tracked by looking at the audio codec chip audio codecs in the 800 series so ALC 897 for instance are entry level and they're fine to get going but if you want better audio then look for audio codecs like the alc 1200 or higher let's talk about Ram also called memory it's what the system uses to temporarily store information it's using right now now for Ram there are a couple of important things to know like how much do you need how fast the ram is and whether or not you need to get ddr4 or ddr5 Ram as we're in the middle of a transition between the two now note we have a whole video on the best RAM for gaming which will be updated for 2023 and we'll link it in the how to build a PC playlist in the video description for a full explanation Ram comes in sticks that are called dims and they're generally bought in kits of either two sticks or four sticks you generally want to use RAM sticks in pairs so avoid using it single stick or three sticks and we never recommend mixing and matching different kits now current Ram comes either as ddr4 or ddr5 ryzen 5000 CPUs only use ddr4 Ram while less than 7000 CPUs only use ddr5 Ram Intel 12 and 13th generation CPUs can actually use ddr4 or ddr5 but not both at the same time that choice is locked in when you buy the motherboard note that there are no motherboards that use both ddr4 and ddr5 the most common memory speeds for ddr4 are between 3000 and 3600 and for ddr5 between 5200 and 6400 speed are common Ram also has a cast latency rating abbreviated CL or C with a number now common cast latencies for ddr4 are cl-14 16 and 18 and for ddr5 they range from cl28 to cl40 on the mainstream kits with a lower the number being the better there is a lot to talk about for best Ram speeds for each and every one of the CPUs so see that best RAM for gaming 2023 video Linked In the description so how much RAM do you need well it depends on what you're doing a general rule of thumb is at least 16 gigabytes for gaming streaming gameplay to a service like twitch or amateur video editing now for professional level streaming or production workloads the minimum I would recommend is 32 gigabytes but if you're designing a system for professional applications then of course check the recommended system requirements for your software packages as you may need even more RAM let's talk about storage because storage has seen massive changes over the past two years as cost for solid state drives called ssds has fallen to the point that I would no longer consider spinning hard disk drives for any role in my PC build even for bulk data storage also the older SATA ssds like this that connected via cable have been completely replaced by nvme ssds that use the m.2 connector on your motherboard and they're significantly faster so for the best PC build 2023 we're focusing exclusively on m.2 nvme ssds and you can currently find storage for under forty dollars for one terabyte with the best price to perform being the two terabyte drive sizes now given the cost of storage is so cheap and that games and other applications have grown in size I recommend at least one terabyte of storage for all but the most budget gaming PC builds and professional users that save a lot of media files like in video editing they should look to have at least two terabytes of storage nvme ssds come in a variety of speeds called pcie generations for the vast majority of consumers pcie gen 3 drives are actually faster than you need but Gen 4 drives are also very cheap right now the newest Gen 5 drives really don't offer consumers any benefit and they're super expensive and by the way many motherboards for currently relevant CPUs we discussed won't even run them at their full rated speed so my advice is to skip them entirely now do note that pcie is backwards compatible so you can always plug in a pcie gen 3 drive into a motherboard with pcie Gen 4 or even Gen 5 it's just going to run at this slower rated speed feed which is still really fast alternatively if you plug in a Gen 5 drive to a motherboard that only supports gen 3 drives it will run but only at the Gen 3 speed CPU coolers they've become increasingly important in 2023 as CPU makers they look to push their chips as fast as possible eating more power and thus producing more heat basically if your CPU overheats it will throttle your performance and that's bad so you want to make sure you give it enough cooling now generally the more cores the CPU has or the more power it requires now I'm looking at you Intel I9 3900k the more cooling it will require now you can do that with an air cooler or an all-in-one liquid cooler also called an AIO or with a custom built liquid Loop cooler now if this is your first PC build or your first build in a while I recommend skipping a custom Loop cooler and going straight for either an air cooler or an all-in-one liquid cooler now note that some ryzen and Intel CPUs come with included box coolers ryzen include coolers they're usually sufficient the way often recommend upgrading to at least a budget Tower air cooler the same goes for 12th gen Intel included box coolers they're absolutely okay to get you going but other than the I3 I typically recommend upgrading them or 13th gen Intel CPUs due to the increasing number of e-cores on the CPU this stock coolers are not great for CPUs above the I5 13400 and I'd recommend an aftermarket cooler replacement for them we have more cooling guides in our how to build a PC playlist and we recommend specific coolers for each CPU in our build guide list so check out those in the video description now getting the right PC case seems easy but there are three critical things that you need to consider number one is good airflow we don't want a thermally throttle our CPU or our GPU so it's important to bring in cool air from the outside and vent out the hot air from the inside for this mesh front or side panels are best while we can buy additional fans for our PC case and we often need to PC cases usually come with at least a couple of included fans in the 1 120 millimeter or 140 millimeter size though there are some cases with much larger 160 millimeter and even 200 millimeter fans how many fans do you need well I recommend at least two to three intake fans as well as at least one exhaust fan in high-end builds with more heat I'd recommend increasing this airflow number two is making sure you buy the right size case for your motherboard like motherboards cases come in different sizes ATX cases will fit ATX size motherboards and smaller ones as well while Micro ATX cases will not fit an ATX full-size motherboard and many small form factor cases will only fit ITX motherboards if you're not sure check the PC case specs before buying it to make sure it will fit your motherboard third let's talk Aesthetics and front panel connections most cases come with a glass side panel to show off your build and the front panel of your case will include USB ports and an audio jack if it has a front panel USB type-c connector you'll want to ensure that your motherboard comes with the right header for it some cases come with RGB lighting effects or strips but most RGB lighting today is on the fans the coolers the RAM and the motherboards themselves the power supply unit or PSU for short supplies power to your PC build but choosing the right PSU it's quite complicated don't worry though we've got a whole video that explains how to size evaluate and buy the best PSU included in our how to build a PC series now psus they come in two main sizes ATX which is the most common and sfx which is for small form factor cases make sure to choose the PSU that best fits your case psus they come in different wattages and they also have different efficiency ratings called 80 plus ratings in either white bronze gold or platinum but these 80 plus ratings they don't necessarily indicate the unit's quality instead we look at a rating system put together by knowledgeable community members called the PSU cultist tier list for a gaming build with a dedicated GPU we recommend using a PSU rated at least C tier or better on that list and as a performance and cost of your CPU and GPU go up we suggest moving up the tier list to B and then a tiers you can think of it like buying car insurance the more expensive your car is the more insurance coverage you want even though you're paying more money for that insurance let's briefly talk about your monitor especially for gaming or video editing PCS now it's critical to get the right monitor for your GPU the main resolutions are still 1080P 1440p and 4K but the mainstream gaming has largely moved on from 1080p to 1440p except for Esports Pros who want the highest FPS for competitive Shooters refresh rates for monitors are commonly 144 to 180 Hertz which you can think of as the maximum FPS a monitor can do at its resolution as long as your GPU can keep up but higher refresh rate 240Hz game monitors are now available even at 4K and 360 Hertz refresh rates are available at 1440p for PC Gamers you typically want to use the DisplayPort connection to ensure that your GPU will utilize variable refresh rate technology on the monitor this prevents screen tearing we have a lot more in our best gaming monitor 2023 video so check it out Linked In the video description aside from the essential components there are miscellaneous Parts like Bannon RGB controllers Wi-Fi add-in cards USB adapters and video capture cards that can improve your computer's functionality for those Building Systems with lots of fans and or RGB lighting a fan or RGB controller or even a combo controller can be very useful if your motherboard lacks Wi-Fi a pcie add-in card or a USB Wi-Fi adapter can provide Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity there are also other components like Thunderbolt add-in cards keyboards and mice and more let me know down in the comments if you have specific requests for future coverage so how much does it cost to build a PC for 2023 gaming PC builds using only brand new parts no use Parts you can range from just over 500 for a budget gaming PC all the way up to three thousand dollars or higher for the highest performance CPU and GPU build focusing primarily on FPS performance and using current U.S pricing and availability for 1080p budget gaming I'd recommend looking to spend around 550 for 1440p gaming at adfps you're looking at around 650 to 900 for 100 plus FPS at 1440p in most titles you're looking at spending between 900 and 1200 and for very high FPS at 4K I'd look to spend between twelve hundred and two thousand dollars with the highest performance builds using an RTX 4090 currently a 1600 GPU by itself jumping up into the three thousand dollar and higher territory here are my top CPU and GPU combos for PC Building in 2023 based on what is currently available at the time of this video of course we do expect more GPU launches throughout 2023. if you're looking for the best budget 1080p gaming PC build I choose Intel I3 1200f or 13100f and a GPU like the RX 6600 6650xt or Intel Arc a750 Nvidia gpus are more expensive and they're lower performance but they do include the RTX 2060 and RTX 3050 you can also consider used options here as well like a still decent RX 588 gigabyte for just 80 used or an NVIDIA GTX 1660 Super 6 gigabyte card for 120 used for 1440p mid-range gaming builds I'd upgrade the CPU to either a ryzen 5600 or an i5 12400 or possibly 13 400 and for the GPU look to get a Radeon RX 6650xt or Arc a750 or going up in performance to the Radeon RX 6700 XT or 6800 you can also consider the RTX 3060 or 3060 TI if you must have an Nvidia GPU but at current pricing they're just not great value gpus for gaming check out our build guides for the I5 12400 and ryzen 5600 and stay subscribed from the upcoming I5 13 400 build guide for high FPS 1440p or 4K gaming build we want to move up in GPU power to an RX 6800 XT rx6950xc or one of the new RX 7900 XT or XTX gpus all with a minimum of 16 gigabytes of vram or higher on the Nvidia side we're looking at an RTX 4070 and 4070 TI both with 12 gigabytes of vram I'd also look to go up in CPU power to a minimum of a ryzen 7600 ryzen 7700 or Intel i5 13600k build but remember GPU is more important than CPU for overall FPS performance the best of the best gaming PC will be an RTX 4090 build with a ryzen 7800 X 3D CPU or possibly the I9 3900k if you're looking for the best PC build for streaming just take the gaming PC build get 32 gigabytes of RAM and add in more storage and consider going with a slightly higher performance CPU and that should get you started streaming isn't as demanding as it used to be on PC Hardware so both the hardware performance itself has gotten better but also the streaming platforms are a lot more optimized and lightweight than they used to be if you're a professional who needs their PC for more multi-threaded applications like blender animation video editing engineering programs and similar tasks then the best PC build 2023 it's going to be slightly different for you you'll definitely want 32 gigabytes or more of ram check the system recommendations for the programs that you use for their recommendations as well because you might need more as well as the relevant CPU with more cores like the ryzen 7700 instead of the 7600 or the I5 13600k into the I5 12400 Intel CPUs tend to have more productivity CPU power per dollar here at the mid-range while the ryzen 7950x is really tough to beat at the high end for the GPU Nvidia tends to have way better application support so that gets my recommendation the more you're doing the long duration multi-core workloads the more you'll want a very capable cooler and good case airflow so your workspace doesn't constantly sound like you're testing jet engines remember we have everything linked down in the video description including Parts build lists and how-to guides
