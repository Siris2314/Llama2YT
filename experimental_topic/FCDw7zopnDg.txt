do you want to put together your very own gaming pc but you're a little bit worried because you've never done it before then congratulations you're in the right place because let me assure you it is actually dead easy and we're going to do it in this video we're going to go through everything step by step and i think the most amount of detail i can possibly do to make sure you know exactly what it is that you're doing and by the end of it you'll be ready to make your very own gaming pc in order to actually build a gaming pc you will of course need quite a few different parts on hand you're going to need to have a chassis to actually put everything inside be quiet who gladly sponsored this video actually supplied this 500dx for this build and this is a great all-rounder because it's not too expensive but it's definitely not a real budget case either it comes with three fans as standard you've got rgb and mesh on the front and it actually shows off all of your different hardware with this tempered glass on the side which is excellent but you are going to need to have a motherboard and a cpu and this is going to be your main starting point really for deciding not only what your pc is going to be capable of doing but sort of dictating exactly how expensive is going to be this is a board from biostar it is a z490 motherboard which means that it is compatible with intel's latest i can't say latest what's going on with me today intel's latest 10th generation processors this is the 10600k this is a six chord processor and it is pretty much one of if not the best option for a gaming pc when it comes to priced performance because you're able to truly unlock the full potential of your graphics cards but you're not paying any more money for cause or extra performance in workload applications that don't matter to gaming at all which does lead us on to the graphics cards here we also have a brilliant mid-range option this is a rtx 2060 this is actually made by nvidia and this is one of nvidia's own cards it has their own cooler on it as well and this is a great little card for 1080p 1440p gaming and because it is an rtx graphics card you can turn on things like ray tracing and dlss in games as well if you're after some sort of fancy effects these are the components that i would describe as your primaries so the case everything that is going to go inside that the way that your pc will actually look the platform with the motherboard and cpu and then actually that graphics card that is going to dictate your fps and most of your money really should be going into the graphics card as that's going to have the biggest amount of impact on your actual gaming performance in terms of ram these days if you can grab 16 gigabytes this is a set of 3600 megahertz ram this is rgb though so you know go faster stripes but of course don't forget that all of these components do require some electricity to actually function and this is where your power supply comes in so this hooks up to the mains and then sends all of the different components all of the juice that they do need to run but not all power supplies are made equally this one for instance is what we call a modular power supply so all of the cables do actually come separately which means you don't need to plug in any cables that you're not going to use which means that your whole build becomes a lot cleaner and it means you can swap it out for some fancier cables later down the line if you want but the main thing really you need to be thinking about is getting something that is very well made reliable going to last sounds quiet be quiet but then also that it has enough wattage to actually supply all of the components with the right amount of power you can't go too high but this will cost you more money but if you don't have enough your experience things like shutdowns crashes and that won't be a very pleasant experience at all this is a 650 watt unit which is perfect for most pc builds and i think unless you're spending thousands of pounds on a pc this is probably all you're going to need in terms of where you're actually going to be putting these games though you're going to need to get yourself a hard drive or a solid state drive so you can grab a traditional spinning hard drive this is two terabytes in size and they're a lot cheaper than ssds these are great for filling up with very large games maybe things like call of duty modern warfare and things very big require a lot of storage but these days most people just go for just flash solid-state storage and you have two options you have this which i can tell just from the weight is the nvme ssd so these things are very small this is from crucial it's called the p5 i would wager though that most people are probably just gonna go for a single sata drive so these ones are a little bit bigger and unlike the nvme drives they don't go on your motherboard these go in your case somewhere and then plug in with cables and these strike the right balance really between capacity so being able to store a lot of things on it who's getting arrested today that's a fire engine probably isn't it now it's an ambulance i'm not very good at this game no sata ssds are perfect for striking the right balance between capacity and speed and because they're a lot cheaper than nvme drives they make a lot more sense for gaming computers because you get more bang for your buck essentially but you will also need a usb stick that has windows pre-loaded on it this is very easy just log into a windows pc insert a stick wipe it and then the windows tool that you can download from the windows website will actually then load this up with a copy of windows just make sure you do get yourself a license key or you have one of those horrible activate window stickers that will never go away now at this stage you may have realized that we haven't actually discussed cooling yet because you're going to need a cpu cooler to actually enable the very small chip on your motherboard to stay cool and not cook itself basically but most of them that you can buy today will come with something that looks loadable like this you can see they're quite small but they're somewhat effective the problem with them is you're not really going to be able to overclock your processor and they tend to be a fair bit louder than third-party solutions which is why if budget permits or of course you have to buy one because your intel cpu doesn't come with one you're going to need to get something from a third party and you're typically looking at something like this it is a shadow rock tf2 it is a be quiet air cooler and this will be a lot higher performance you can see it's rated for 160 watts tdp or you can grab yourself an all-in-one liquid cooler this uses a radiator and then water and a pump that's actually on a pump head that sits on top of your cpu and this then creates like a little loop as the name silent loop would suggest whereby the heat actually goes up to the radiator and then the fans blow that out of the case now interestingly what i think a lot of people don't realize is that when you do build a pc you don't actually need to use your case straight away because you want to build on top of the motherboard first you have a few different components that actually seat directly into this so it makes sense to do this on the motherboard box as it is non-conductive and you have so much more light in here and you don't have to sort of be reaching in and making life more difficult for yourself so simply grab your motherboard box and then you'll find you're fairly delicate but at the same time unlikely to break unless you're throwing it around motherboards you can have a good look at this as i say this is the heart of your computer this is the racing one from biostar and it looks really neat and tidy actually you have this little back plate pre-applied to it which is cool but just grab that place it aside for a second and then if you're using a sata ssd or a hard drive of any description you're going to need to go into your box and then take out some of these sata cables as these are what is actually going to allow you to communicate from the hard drive or the ssd to the motherboard then grab yourself an array of screwdrivers you're looking for a phillips cross head screwdriver an ideally a magnetic one but if you have one with a ratchet that also works quite nicely as well switching to markers cam patent pending we can see this is what the motherboard looks like up close so this is where our cpu is going to go in this little socket here these are what we call the ram slots you can see we have four on this z490 board so you can put up to four different sticks of ram in here and we're going to want to install them in a set order which is this slot here first so we can open this little notch to remind us and then the one at the end we've got nvme ssd slots underneath here these are our sata ports so this is where we're going to plug in any hard drives we have these are the pcie slots so where we're actually going to place our graphics card down into these but if you do have like a streaming capture card or something you'll use these as well down the bottom we've got a load of tiny things these are very important these are your fan headers so you plug your case fans and any calling really they go in here our hd audio as it's called is this little thing here and that's just the front panel audio so when you plug in your headphones it actually works goes straight to the motherboard we've got usb here for all of the usb devices either connected inside our pc or on the front panel we plug all of our different case buttons so things like the button to actually turn it on or the reset switch all of these things connect down here and just look in your motherboard manual it will tell you what each one does we've got usb 3 as well which looks slightly different we do have all of these power connections we've got this very big one here it's called the atx power and you can't miss it because it's huge and then you do also have some cpu ones at the top as well the cpu ones you only need to use the one on the left normally you don't need to connect both of them that's just if you're going to do some extreme overclocking so i hope you enjoyed marcus cam that was a little clever idea wasn't it but to actually get started on your build it's incredibly simple simply grab your processor out of the box pick up this little lever and then lift it up there is a little gold arrow so line that up with the arrow that's on the motherboard and then gently drop your cpu down into place then it's time to grab your ram out of the box and the slots that we've opened up earlier you just need to find the little notch in the base line it up with the notch that you actually have on your ram stick itself but they just drop in real nice and easy they make an audible click and there you have your cpu and ram combo if you're using an nvme ssd then this is when you're going to need to grab that smaller screwdriver and your nvme drive from your stack it is generally good practice to use the top slot as you're less likely to run into any issues there is actually some like thermal pads that are on the bottom of this heatsink and you need to take this little bit of plastic off or it's not going to do anything grab your little ssd insert it no force required and then screw it back down this is our cpu cooler then you can see it's big but not too big but this is pretty simple to install you're just going to need your mounting hardware that comes in the box you have a back plate so lift up your motherboard find those big holes that you really can't miss and then line this up with the back plate this motherboard then has these tiny little c-clips that go onto those posts that you've just poked through then just grab your little mounting brackets and attach the screws through ready to go on then grab these brackets place them on top of the cooler and screw them in the four screws provided then it should just be a case of dropping this down on top of the motherboard we're going to do a little test fit to make sure everything's in place which it looks like it is but you are going to need to put some thermal paste on top of your cpu your cooler may have some pre-applied but otherwise you just need to grab a very small amount from a tube and then just dot this on top of your cpu this bit could be a little bit fiddly as we then place the cooler on top of the motherboard and then we have to very carefully lift it up and screw from the other side try to tighten everything up in a cross pattern as this reduces any stress on the cpu socket itself diving back into marcus cam you're going to need to grab your little fan cable that we found earlier and where it says here cpu simply plug that in if you have two different fans on your cpu cooler then one goes in cpu fan the other one goes in cpu optional this is the really exciting bit then when you can actually start to see your build come alive and grab the case taking the side panel off just unscrew the tempered glass and then do the same with the rear you have these things called standoffs here that your motherboard will sit on they're pre-applied for large full-size atx motherboards but if you're using micro atx or mini itx you're gonna have to move some of these around around the back of the case this is where you're going to have to do all of that cable management and things but everything comes pre-done for you as much as it can do you've got these little cables here these are things like hd audio so this connects to the bottom of the motherboard we've got usb type-c as well which is a brand new connector we've got that big usb 3 that we talked about earlier we've got those little case connections that go down the bottom again check your motherboard manual to know where these go we've got an rgb header and then we have some fan headers step one then is to get your case and lay it down flat grab your motherboard and then just gently or at least as gently as you possibly can lower this into place as predicted we do have a little bit of a clearance issue in that the motherboard doesn't actually fit in with this rear fan in its current location so what you would do is unplug this fan and place it somewhere else the way you do this is to remove the dust filter on the top and then you see that there are some pre-done holes at the top and you've got two different channels you've got one that are for the smaller 120 millimeter fans or ones like this that are 140 for the larger fans so we're going to put it here and i'm matching the orientation so the label is facing upwards so that the air is blown out of the case but you could do it the other way if you wanted to is at this point you probably realize you don't have enough hands and you start looking like a bit of an idiot but then again i was told that when i was i don't know about 10 in school so i'm quite used to it oh that got deep didn't it brilliant so that's that fan moved and we can now try and insert our motherboard once again once you've clicked into place you then need to grab the screws that come with your case and then actually start screwing the motherboard down so that it's nice and secure within your enclosure and then you'll have something along the lines of this which is pretty quirky actually you don't see many builds these days that have top flow coolers especially ones that remove the rear fan and have it like this but you know what i really like how it's different i think that's pretty cool this is when you need to grab those sata cables that we mentioned that you take from the motherboard box they have these little catches on them and these just go in these little sockets here turn your attention around the back and this is where it doesn't get complicated but it gets a bit monotonous so we need to start plugging in all of these cables but i do like to put the drives in first our hard drive if you're using one of those requires a hard drive cage and the system in this be quiet case is brilliant as you just take the whole cage out grab your hard drive make sure the connectors are facing you and then you just slide it into the cage grab the screws once again from your case accessories box and then just get this in there nice and tight or even faster solid state drive though has its own unique place in these bays at the back so once again you take the whole bay out and then you screw this down and then put the whole thing back in then you can start plugging them in so grab that sata data cable that you got earlier but do remember you need to power them or they're not going to do anything while we're at the back here though it's time to grab the rest of the cables and start plugging them in so we're going to do the fans first we have two at the top and one at the front so we should have a total of three fan cables so you just need to find three fan headers on your motherboard plot these into place so now we can come around to the other side and here i've got all the fan headers and hd audio and we're going to plug these in which is very fiddly then do the same with the usb 3.0 noting that the usbc that we have on this particular case isn't compatible with this motherboard you'd need to get a converter for that to work and then last but certainly not least is those power connections for the actual case itself so the main one being the power switch sometimes it's reset sometimes it's leds and things again consult your motherboard manual to know exactly where you need to go but they just slot straight into place at this stage we are actually almost there believe it or not there's just two components left to go it doesn't really matter which order you do it in but i think putting the power supply in last makes more sense so we're gonna put our graphics card in now we're going to need a screwdriver and we're going to need to remove these pcie covers these little like mesh things that you see at the back then line your graphics card up with the slot that you're going to use then with your screwdriver screw those thumb screws back down into place to keep everything nice and safe and secure collecting our power supply is incredibly simple in this case as you get a little bracket on the bottom in this very big hole and you grab your little bracket place it on top of your power supply with the fan facing downwards and then you screw this in together and then you screw the whole like bracket power supply combination into the case don't forget to actually plug in those power connections before you put this in your case as it is a lot easier to do this now than later you should push them in as far as they will go until you hear an audible click make sure that you feed all of those cables that you've now connected through into the pc chamber and push the whole unit into the case easy peasy lemon squeezy and then feed all of these big cables into their respective positions so the graphics card is going to go through the chamber and up the big fat one is going to come through at the top the cpu cable is going to go all the way through the top this is our graphics card our ginormous atx and then the cpu is all the way up here at the top which leaves us with the very last task of plugging in our sata power to those drives so here we have an ssd the shapes are exactly the same as the saturn data but slightly longer and then we need to plug in our hard drive it's now time to get this thing plugged in make sure everything works before you do this it is worth actually having a quick run to make sure everything is plugged in so anything that's slightly loose should be pushed in a little bit further if possible you need to have your cpu your atx your graphics card and when you do plug your computer in make sure you use the graphics cards ports rather than the ones on the motherboard i know it's tempting when you've got hdmi on your motherboard but that's not going to do anything you want to output from your graphics card ah so this is the nervous bit then and i assure you the first time you put together your computer this is the bit you'll be dreading but the adrenaline levels especially when you turn it on and it does work is so worth it make sure you grab your usb drive you can plug this in at the front if you have windows it should actually start loading into this automatically might go into the bios it depends i guess on your exact motherboard the only thing i've done so far is actually plug it in at the back and the rgb memory has already gone a bit ballistic because it's crucial ballistics but i also remembered i did not plug in my rgb strip that we mentioned so this plugs into the rgb header on the motherboard and because they're magnetic you can put them wherever you like so let's give this a go we press the on button and it did something it usually does this like power cycle and it goes through a few times before you actually get an output this is usually a good sign it's not always but so far so good and then we should start to see something on the display once it's done its initial boot sequence and then this is the bit in the video where i just keep talking and talking to try and distract uh from the fact that i am nervous as to whether my pc that i've spent ages is going to work or not but if things don't go to plan there's usually an error code down at the bottom that will tell you what's going on and what the problem might be is our monitor on is our monitor on that could be oh it's not is it every single time why can i not do a simple task a o which usually means all okay and here we go congratulations ladies and gentlemen you have successfully put together your own gaming pc and i think this actually looks really cool i love how it's very unique and the be quiet style is usually a little bit understated if you enjoyed this video please hit the like button it helps out so so much you really wouldn't believe if you want to see another video as to what to do next what should you put on your gaming pc what applications how do you get games running i don't know all of these things a bit of tuning i think i'm actually going to take this pc to the next level shall we say in that video so stay tuned for that but thank you so much for watching get subscribed check out all the other builds on the channel those go through different benchmarks and things as well if you want to see uh performance and all that good stuff but i really appreciate your time thank you and i'll see in the next one [Music] you
